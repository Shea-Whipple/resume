      Dear Clearwater Analytics,I am writing to express my interest in the Data
      Analyst position at Clearwater Analytics. With mybackground in computer
      science, and hands-on experience in control systems and data analysis, Iam
      excited about the opportunity to contribute to your team and help drive
      innovative solutions.During my internship at the Clark County Water
      Reclamation District (CCWRD), I had theopportunity to work on several
      critical projects that required technical proficiency, attention, and
      acollaborative spirit. For example, I successfully connected the
      "Robindale" remote chemical feed siteto the SCADA system, which involved
      wiring and programming a peristaltic chemical feed pumpand a hydrostatic
      pressure transmitter. Additionally, I programmed and tested 14
      communicationnetwork devices to operate over a secured network PCN,
      ensuring data accuracy and reliability forthe remote chemical feed
      sites.Moreover, I gained valuable experience in assembling and wiring
      control panels, configuring 4 to20 mA instrumentation devices to
      Allen-Bradley MicroLogix PLCs, and performing top-side safetywatch duties
      for underground pumping station maintenance. These tasks not only honed
      mytechnical skills but also reinforced my ability to work
      effectively.Beyond my technical expertise, I am committed to fostering a
      professional work environment. Myexperience at Smiths, where I developed
      strong social and team skills, has equipped me to managetasks efficiently
      and thrive under pressure. Furthermore, my academic journey at the College
      ofIdaho, where I am pursuing a Bachelor's degree in Computer Science with
      a Data Sciencespecialization, has provided me with a solid foundation in
      programming languages, data analysis,and project management.I am
      particularly drawn to Clearwater Analytics because of its commitment to
      data integrity. I ameager to bring my skills in programming, data
      analysis, control systems, and teamwork toClearwater Analytics and
      contribute to its continued success.Thank you for considering my
      application. I look forward to the possibility of discussing how
      mybackground, skills, and enthusiasm can be an asset to your
      team.Regards,Shea Whipple
